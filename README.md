# **Universe Marketplace contracts:**

- **TransferManager** - Responsible for transferring all assets. The manager supports different types of fees, also it supports different beneficiaries.
- **TransferExecutor** - Responsible for executing the transfers from one side of the order to the other side of the order. The transfer executor calls the respective TransferProxy, depending on the asset type - ERC721, ERC721_BUNDLE, ERC20, ERC1155.
- **TransferProxies** - The actual contracts which are approved by the users to transfer their assets - currently there is ERC20TransferProxy and NFTTransferProxy
- **MarketplaceCore** - Responsible for matching orders through the matchOrders function. Extends TransferManager and TransferExecutor
- **ERC721FloorBidMatcher** - This contract uses the same transfer proxies, but works with onchain transactions and escrow of the userâ€™s funds, which are placed with a buy order.
